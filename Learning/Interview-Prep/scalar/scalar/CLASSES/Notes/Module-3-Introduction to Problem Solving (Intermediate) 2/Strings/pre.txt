StringBuilder
It also provides us mutable strings but here we lack thread safety. It cannot be used by multiple threads simultaneously. Since the class is not applying this extra feature like StringBuffer here it becomes faster than it.

Syntax

StringBuilder a= new StringBuilder("Scaler");

Code

StringBuilder temp=new StringBuilder();
//Initial size of object
System.out.println(temp.capacity());
StringBuilder a= new StringBuilder("String");
System.out.println(a);
//updating the string
a.append(" Articles");
System.out.println(a);
a=new StringBuilder("InterviewBit");
System.out.println(a);

Output

16
String
String Articles
InterviewBit
