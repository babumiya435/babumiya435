2.meta tags

	The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

	<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

	Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

	Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

	There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).
	<head>
	 <meta charset="UTF-8">
	<head>
		UTF-8 is a character encoding system. It lets you represent characters as ASCII text, while still allowing for international characters, such as Chinese characters. As of the mid 2020s, UTF-8 is one of the most popular encoding systems.

	<head>
	 <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  	 <meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
	<head>

	HTML lets you specify metadata - additional important information about a document in a variety of ways. The META elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry date, a list of keywords, document author etc.

	The <meta> tag is used to provide such additional information. This tag is an empty element and so does not have a closing tag but it carries information within its attributes.

	You can include one or more meta tags in your document based on what information you want to keep in your document but in general, meta tags do not impact physical appearance of the document so from appearance point of view, it does not matter if you include them or not.
	USES:
		-Specifying Keywords(SEO)
			You can use <meta> tag to specify important keywords related to the document and later these keywords are used by the search engines while indexing your webpage for searching purpose.
			 <meta name = "keywords" content = "HTML, Meta Tags, Metadata" />
		-Document Description
			You can use <meta> tag to give a short description about the document. This again can be used by various search engines while indexing your webpage for searching purpose.
      			<meta name = "description" content = "Learning about Meta Tags." />
		-Document Revision Date
			You can use <meta> tag to give information about when last time the document was updated. This information can be used by various web browsers while refreshing your webpage.
			<meta name = "revised" content = "Tutorialspoint, 3/7/2014" />
		-Document Refreshing
			A <meta> tag can be used to specify a duration after which your web page will keep refreshing automatically.
			If you want your page keep refreshing after every 5 seconds then use the following syntax.
			<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "5" />
		-Page Redirection
			Following is an example of redirecting current page to another page after 5 seconds. If you want to redirect page immediately then do not specify content attribute.
			<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "5; url = http://www.tutorialspoint.com" />
		-Setting Cookies
			Cookies are data, stored in small text files on your computer and it is exchanged between web browser and web server to keep track of various information based on your web application need.
			You can use <meta> tag to store cookies on client side and later this information can be used by the Web Server to track a site visitor.
			<meta http-equiv = "cookie" content = "userid = xyz; expires = Wednesday, 08-Aug-15 23:59:59 GMT;" />
		-Setting Author Name
			You can set an author name in a web page using meta tag
			<meta name = "author" content = "Sameer Mohammad" />
		-Specify Character Set
			By default, Web servers and Web browsers use ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) encoding to process Web pages. Following is an example to set UTF-8 encoding −
			<meta http-equiv = "Content-Type" content = "text/html; charset = UTF-8" />
			To serve the static page with traditional Chinese characters, the webpage must contain a <meta> tag to set Big5 encoding −
			<meta http-equiv = "Content-Type" content = "text/html; charset = Big5" />
		-Specify Page Dimensions
			It specifies the viewport to control the page dimension and scaling so that our website looks good on all devices. If this tag is present, it indicates that this page is mobile device supported.
			<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
